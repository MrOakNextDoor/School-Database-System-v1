# School Database System
The School Database System (SDS), as the name implies, is a database system to help in keeping records.

### Features:
- Easy-to-use Interface
- Quick loading of records
- Backup system with Google Drive

### Why not just use a spreadsheet like Excel or Google Docs then?
The SDS is dedicated to storing school-related information, while Excel or Google Docs are more multi-purpose.
